            <p>
              HiðŸ‘‹ I'm Elene, a full-stack developer from Georgia. I love art and
              creating beautiful, easy-to-use websites. I started out as a game
              developer using Unity and, after gaining some experience working
              in the industry, I transitioned into web development - my true
              passion.
